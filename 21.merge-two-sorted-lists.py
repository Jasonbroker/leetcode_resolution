#
# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list
# should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
# Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        res 
        if l1.val > l2.val
        curl1 = l1
        curl2 = l2
        while not curl1 and not curl1.next:

        
# @lc code=end
